# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the backend implementation for a private lending marketplace that enables peer-to-peer lending between borrowers and lenders. The system will be built using AWS serverless technologies (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway) and will integrate with an existing Next.js frontend application.

The backend follows a simplified "accept-only" MVP approach where lenders can only accept loan invitations (no decline functionality) and borrowers can only create loans (no cancel/modify functionality). This reduces complexity while maintaining all core functionality needed for a functional lending marketplace.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and login to the platform so that I can access borrower and/or lender functionality based on my invitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers with email and password THEN the system SHALL create a user account with is_borrower=true and is_lender=false by default
2. WHEN a user registers with an email that has pending lender invitations THEN the system SHALL automatically set is_lender=true and mark invitations as activated
3. WHEN an existing user logs in THEN the system SHALL check for new pending invitations and update their lender status if found
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token and complete user object including role flags
5. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
6. WHEN a JWT token is provided with API requests THEN the system SHALL validate the token and extract user information

### Requirement 2: Loan Management

**User Story:** As a borrower, I want to create loan requests and invite specific lenders so that I can raise funds for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a borrower creates a loan THEN the system SHALL store loan details including amount, interest rate, term, purpose, and description
2. WHEN a borrower invites lenders during loan creation THEN the system SHALL create invitation records for new emails and participant records for all lenders
3. WHEN a loan is created THEN the system SHALL set initial status to "PENDING" and total_funded to 0
4. WHEN a user requests loan details THEN the system SHALL return loan information only if they are the borrower or an invited lender
5. WHEN a borrower requests their loans THEN the system SHALL return all loans they have created with current funding status
6. WHEN loan details are requested THEN the system SHALL include participant information and funding progress

### Requirement 3: Lender Invitation and Acceptance

**User Story:** As a lender, I want to view pending loan invitations and accept loans I'm interested in so that I can invest my money and earn returns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lender requests pending invitations THEN the system SHALL return all loan invitations where their status is "PENDING"
2. WHEN a lender accepts a loan invitation THEN the system SHALL update their participation status to "ACCEPTED" and record timestamp
3. WHEN a lender accepts a loan THEN the system SHALL save their ACH banking details for the specific loan
4. WHEN a lender accepts a loan THEN the system SHALL update the loan's total_funded amount with their contribution
5. WHEN a loan becomes fully funded THEN the system SHALL automatically change loan status from "PENDING" to "ACTIVE"
6. WHEN a lender acceptance fails THEN the system SHALL ensure no partial updates occur (atomic transaction)

### Requirement 4: User Profile and Dashboard Data

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my profile information and dashboard statistics so that I can track my lending/borrowing activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their profile THEN the system SHALL return user information excluding sensitive data like password hashes
2. WHEN a borrower requests dashboard data THEN the system SHALL calculate and return statistics including active loans, total borrowed, and pending requests
3. WHEN a lender requests dashboard data THEN the system SHALL calculate and return statistics including pending invitations, total lent, and expected returns
4. WHEN a user has both borrower and lender roles THEN the system SHALL return statistics for both roles
5. WHEN dashboard statistics are calculated THEN the system SHALL ensure real-time accuracy based on current database state

### Requirement 5: Data Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to ensure all data is properly validated and secured so that user information and financial data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
2. WHEN sensitive banking information is stored THEN the system SHALL leverage DynamoDB encryption at rest
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens and reject unauthorized requests
4. WHEN loan amounts are processed THEN the system SHALL validate numeric values are positive and within reasonable limits
5. WHEN email addresses are processed THEN the system SHALL validate email format before storing
6. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without exposing internal details

### Requirement 6: System Integration and Performance

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the backend API to integrate seamlessly with the existing Next.js application so that users have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL return data in the exact format expected by existing frontend components
2. WHEN CORS requests are made from the frontend domain THEN the system SHALL allow the requests with proper headers
3. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use efficient access patterns with DynamoDB GSIs
5. WHEN multiple users access the system concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle requests without performance degradation
6. WHEN the system experiences errors THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information for debugging while maintaining user privacy

### Requirement 7: Business Logic and Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to ensure business rules are enforced and data remains consistent across all operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a loan is created THEN the system SHALL ensure the sum of all lender contributions equals the total loan amount
2. WHEN a lender accepts an invitation THEN the system SHALL verify the invitation is still valid and not already accepted
3. WHEN loan funding is updated THEN the system SHALL prevent double-spending by using atomic transactions
4. WHEN a loan reaches full funding THEN the system SHALL automatically activate the loan without manual intervention
5. WHEN invitation records are created THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate invitations for the same email and loan
6. WHEN user roles are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity across all related records

### Requirement 8: API Design and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the system, I want clear and consistent API endpoints so that I can easily build applications on top of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are designed THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions for resource naming and HTTP methods
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON structure across all endpoints
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use Bearer token authentication consistently across all protected endpoints
5. WHEN API versioning is needed THEN the system SHALL support backward compatibility for existing integrations
6. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the system SHALL return appropriate headers indicating current usage and limits

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging so that I can maintain system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN the system SHALL log all requests with correlation IDs for tracing
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information without exposing sensitive data
3. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track response times, error rates, and throughput
4. WHEN system alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL notify administrators of critical issues via appropriate channels
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all data modifications with user identification and timestamps
6. WHEN system health is monitored THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing key performance indicators
